This is the Extended "Translation" Patch Version for the Modpack called GTL -> https://github.com/nutant233/GregTech-Leisure -> https://www.mcmod.cn/modpack/769.html -> id advise to "download" the pack via the mcmod website, you can use website translation to find the 123.cloudstorage link and somehow download the GregTech Leisure-1.3.1.7.zip file --- otherwise here is a link i found for a google drive download for the version we base our patches on -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6M0eVKTRAx_Pzixe0peMwXmoCitNYKi/view 

I mostly just added mods that i felt were missing, like a few qol and building related ones, 2 for terrain gen like Tectonica and also ofc Create. If you have Troubles with JEI/EMI disable EMI first and see if its better then, the mod can be a bit jank at times.

The Pack is based on Chinese and sadly alot of it was baked into non language files. Also there is still remaining Chinese tooltips since they sadly ship a custom Jar of GTCEU Modern with changed files and added java classes to make this pack work. Aka you cant just update this pack yourself.

For Now i dont have a proper way to give a install instructions, i am gonna look into what the best option is 

i made a very basic translation patch here -> https://github.com/KuramA-777/GTL---Basic-Translation-Patch
