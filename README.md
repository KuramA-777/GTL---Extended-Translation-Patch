This is the Extended "Translation" Patch Version for the Modpack called GTL -> https://github.com/nutant233/GregTech-Leisure -> https://www.mcmod.cn/modpack/769.html -> id advise to "download" the pack via the github and get that up working as an instance in Prism or whichever Launcher of your choosing and then apply this Patch afterwards.

I mostly just added mods that i felt were missing, like a few qol and building related ones, 2 for terrain gen like Tectonica and also ofc Create. If you have Troubles with JEI/EMI disable EMI first and see if its better then, the mod can be a bit jank at times.

The Pack is based on Chinese and sadly alot of it was baked into non language files. Also there is still remaining Chinese tooltips since they sadly ship a custom Jar of GTCEU Modern with changed files and added java classes to make this pack work. Aka you cant just update this pack yourself.

To install this you use the function of "Update from file" inside Prism (i dont know if other launchers have this aswell) after you installed the regular TFG Modern modpack, the mentioned function is in the Curseforge Tab when you right click the instance and click edit.

i made a very basic translation patch here -> https://github.com/KuramA-777/GTL---Basic-Translation-Patch
