Annealing generally involves heating the copper to a certain temperature, holding it for a period of time, and then slowly cooling it. This process causes the copper's grain structure to rearrange and grow, which improves its mechanical properties and processing characteristics. Annealed copper is widely used in the manufacture of wire, tubing and various processed products."
